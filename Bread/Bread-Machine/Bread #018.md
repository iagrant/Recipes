- 1 3/4 Cups of water (I added 1/2 a Cup while it was mixing) - 2 1/4 Cup total

Others:
- 2tsp of yeast

## Tips / Directions
Mix all wet into a bowl and let sit for atleast 5minutes to gel up. Mix and almost wisk it after it has gelled up.

Mix all dry into a bowl and mix after each flour so it gets all evenly mixed.
Put wet then dry and finally then yeast into the machine.
Scrap the sides with a spattula after 3-5mins so it gets evenly mixed and no clumps of flour are on the side of the pan.
After 2nd mixing flatten top with spattula.
