## Tips / Directions
Mix all wet into a bowl and let sit for atleast 5minutes to gel up. Mix and almost wisk it after it has gelled up.

Mix all dry into a bowl and mix after each flour so it gets all evenly mixed.
Put WET in 1st then DRY and finally then yeast into the machine.
Scrap the sides with a spattula after 3-5mins so it gets evenly mixed and no clumps of flour are on the side of the pan.
After 2nd mixing flatten top with spattula.
