## Tips / Directions
Mix all wet into a bowl and let sit for atleast 5minutes to gel up. Mix and almost wisk it after it has gelled up.

Mix all dry into a bowl and mix after each flour so it gets all evenly mixed.
Put DRY in 1st then WET and finally then yeast into the machine, this way it mixes in together a lot easier.
Scrap the sides with a spattula after 3-5mins so it gets evenly mixed and no clumps of flour are on the side of the pan.
