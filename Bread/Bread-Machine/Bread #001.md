## Bread #001 (


Modified from this [recipe](https://www.fearlessdining.com/gluten-free-bread-machine-bread)

Dry
- 1 Cup of sorghum flour
- 1/2 Cup of Teff flour
- 1 1/2 Cups of Tapioca Starch/four (not Casava flour)
- 2TBsp of ground flaxseed meal
- 2TBsp of sugar
- 1tsp of sea salt
- 1tsp of baking powder 
- 

Wet
- 1tsp of chia seeds & 2 teaspons of water to replace 1tsp of xantham gum
- 2TBsp of flaxseed meal & 6TBsp of water to replace 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup of light oil (canola)
- 1tsp of apple cider vinegar
- 2tsp of yeast (reduce at altitude!!)
- 1 1/2 Cups of water



## Lessons learned:
- At altitude less yeast is needed and some recommend reducing the starches and replacing that volume with heavier flours or just reducing volume entirely.

## Plan for Bread #002
- reduce yeast to 1 1/2 tsp
- reduce tapioca starch to 1 Cup
- potentially incread Teff to 1 cup to offset reduction of Tapioca or add 1/4 cup to both Teff & Sorghum.
